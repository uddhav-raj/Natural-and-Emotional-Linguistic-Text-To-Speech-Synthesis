# Natural-and-Linguistic-Text-To-Speech-Synthesis
A real time system to synthesise emotional and natural human-like
sound from unstructured text was built. The whole system has three
parts. The first part deals with extracting emotion out of text using
text mining and LSTMs. The second part identifies the key features of
speech for Speech Emotion Recognition. In the third part these
attributes are modified in a neutral speech to give it an emotional
and human-like base.
